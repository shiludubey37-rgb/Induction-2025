* my first day at 'GNDEC 'was the begning of my first step towards the journey of my goal. It was the  day when I have choosed GNDEC for my best carear and develop best personality.
  At the very fist we started our day at the collage Gurudwara sahib,surrounded by peace and positivity. The sound of bhajan like "Dhan Dhan guru Anant sahib ji " and Guru Ramdas Rakho sharnayi"made the atmosphere calm and comforting. After prayers and saying "Waheguru ji ka khalsa,Waheguru ji ki fateh," we received kadah prasad,which added sweetness to the moment.
